/**
 * An implementation of Bitcoin.
 * <p></p>
 * Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system introduced as open source
 * software in 2009 by developer Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital currency
 * created and used in the system is also called bitcoin and is
 * alternatively referred to as a virtual currency, electronic money,
 * or cryptocurrency. The bitcoin system is not controlled by a single entity,
 * like a central bank, which has led the US Treasury to call bitcoin a
 * decentralized currency. Economists generally agree that it does not
 * meet the definition of money.
